This is a short 2D sidescroller shooting game called "Ghost of Downtown".
The objective is to eliminate all the enemies as fast as you can.
To run the project, you must extract all of the files in one place (using the extract all option),
making sure the "images" folder is in the same folder as the code. Then you must
run "lvl1_v1.9.py" in an editor. I'm only using the CMU graphics module and some other built-in
modules of Python. The font I'm using is "monospace", which shouldn't have to be installed separately.
